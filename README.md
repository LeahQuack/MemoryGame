# MemoryGame
Project Two for the Udacity FEND Nanodegree -- the memory game!

## Prerequisites
JavaScript enabled on your local browser.

## Built With
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com) used for the majority of the functionality
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) used for the icons
* [Coda Font Family](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Coda) For the awesome Coda font

## Game Play
* [Click here](https://leahquack.github.io/MemoryGame/) to play the game!

The game board is a grid of 16 virtual cards with eight sets of different icons.  The player is trying to click both cards with the same icon to get a match.

- The clock will not start until you've made your first card choice.
- Click a card, view the icon
- Click another card, view the icon.  If they match, Congratulations! If they don't, the cards will turn over and you will make your new selections.
- Try to remember the placement of each icon so you can match the next card you click!
- The game is over once the player has successfully matched all 8 pairs!
- The star-rating will go down as you use moves:

16 moves knocks you down to two stars & 24 moves knocks you to one!

### For me TODO:
[ ] Customize the CSS

[ ] Customize the icons

[ ] Add a leaderboard

### Special Thanks
Special thanks to Matthew Cranford and Mike Wales for their walkthroughs, and W3 schools for their in-depth information.

This is my first time coding so much JavaScript and if it weren't for my classmates in Slack and the awesome resources provided by the Udacity team, I don't think I would have finished!  Fingers crossed I can get the last three projects done prior to the end of the scholarship!
