# MemoryGame
Project Two for the Udacity FEND Nanodegree -- the memory game!
Special thanks to Matthew Cranford and Mike Wales for their walkthroughs, and W3 schools for their in-depth information.
This is my first time coding so much JavaScript and if it weren't for my classmates in Slack and the awesome resources provided by the Udacity team, I don't think I would have finished!  Fingers crossed I can get the last three projects done prior to the end of the scholarship!

## Game Play
The clock will not start until you've made your first card choice.
The star-rating will go down as you move up in moves:
16 moves knocks you down to two stars & 24 moves knocks you to one!
There are 8 total pairs.

### TODO:
I eventually want to customize the CSS & symbols, but for now I am using the master files, which provided the HTML and CSS, through Udacity.
